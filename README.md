# jupyterhub-istio-proxy

`jupyterhub-istio-proxy` is a jupyterhub proxy api implementation that is responsible for configuring istio based on requests from hub.

The following requests are supported:
1. `GET /api/routes`: Gets all routes that have been configured on istio
2. `POST /api/routes/<path>`: Add the route to istio
3. `DELETE /api/routes/<path>`: Remove the route from istio

Since the proxy is stateless, it can be scaled horizontally. Multiple replicas can be used to ensure uptime during deployments and handle pod failure.

## Prerequisites

In order to use the `jupyterhub-istio-proxy` the following prerequisites need to be met.
1. The Kubernetes cluster should have istio enabled.
2. If an [istio gateway](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/gateway/) is used, it should be setup to handle traffic for the FQDN where the jupyterhub instance is exposed.
3. The service account used for deploying the `jupyterhub-istio-proxy` should have ability to list, get, create and delete istio virtual services in the namespace where the deployment is done. Refer [Kubernetes RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#role-and-clusterrole) for details.

### Difference to the configurable-http-proxy

Unlike the default `configurable-http-proxy` that ships with istio, the traffic is not routed through the proxy itself. The proxy configures istio to handle all traffic to the notebook servers as well as Jupyterhub. As a result, the `proxy-public` service is not needed when using `jupyterhub-istio-proxy`

## Deployment

The proxy can be deployed to a Kubernetes namespace running Jupyterhub by applying the following config:
Change SUB_DOMAIN_HOST to a value to a hostname where jupyterhub is hosted. The ISTIO_GATEWAY value should be set to
the gateway which handles traffic for jupyterhub.
